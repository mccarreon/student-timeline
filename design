1. Problem

Students need a central hub to see a timeline for their Academic Year. 

Ex:

    |----------------------|------------|-----------------|----------|
Fall 18               Winter 18     Spring 19       Summer 19     Fall 19

On this timeline, we should be able to specify different events and 
have them appear on the timeline. 

The following data will be needed to generate the timeline:
- Academic Year
  - Academic Periods 
    - Start/End Date

This should allow us to construct the nodes necessary for an Academic Year.

In order to show an accurate timeline, we would need to show the number of periods in an Academic Year + 1, so we can display any events that occur between the last Academic Period of the selected year, and the first Academic Period of the next year.

Ex: Semester Year:
- Fall 18
- Winter 18
- Spring 19
- Summer 19
- Fall 19

Quarter Year:
- Fall Quarter 18
- Winter Quarter 18
- Spring Quarter 19
- Summer Quarter 19
- Fall Quarter 19

Trimester Year:
- Fall 18
- Winter 18
- Spring 19
- Summer 19
- Fall 18

Nodes should be evenly spaced.
